# Machine-learning-project-mobile-price-classification
Developed a machine learning model for college project to predict the price of the mobile phones. Different machine learning algorithms like random forest classifier, Logistic regression was used for the project. Cross validation and hyper parameter tuning was performed and selectKbest feature selection was used to reduce feature dimensions.
